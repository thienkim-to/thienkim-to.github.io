### Detect Food Trends from Facebook Posts: Co-occurence Matrix, Lift and PPMI

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/linear-regression.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.</div>
