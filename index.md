[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/linear-regression.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">This is a project that I pratice to create a predict model in Python. Firstly, I am going to explore the dataset to understand the concept and discover insights hidden in the dataset. Then, I will select variables that effect on the target variable. Lastly, building model by Linear Regression is the most important stage. The final output is a model which can predict the insurance charges based on age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status and region.</div>
